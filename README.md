# TrackURL

A quick-and-dirty Sublime Text 2 plugin for tracking the contents of a URL in a second pane. I use it to help students follow along when I'm teaching Coding Stuff. You push content up to the web, it pulls it down into the pane.

## Installation

### OS X

1. Open up Finder
2. Command+Shift+G
3. Type in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/`
4. Copy the `track_url` (or whatever it's called) directory into that folder
5. Open up Sublime Text 2 and rejoice

Or, if you're fancy, just clone the repo into that folder.

### Windows

Copy the folder to `%appdata%\Sublime Text 2` and you'll be good to go

## Use

`command + shift + P`, type "Track URL" and select it. Type in the URL to track (or have it already selected) and hit enter. It'll update every 2 seconds.

Or! If you like menus, `Tools > Track Url`.
